Health is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.
In humans, it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self-manage
when facing physical, mental, or social challenges. The most widely accepted
definition of good health is that of the World Health Organization Constitution.
It states: "health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
and is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (World Health Organization, 1946).
In more recent years, this statement has been amplified to include the ability to lead
a "socially and economically productive life." The WHO definition is not without
criticism; mainly that it is much too broad.
The most solid aspects of wellness that fit firmly in the realm of
medicine are environmental health, nutrition, disease prevention,
and public health. These matters can be investigated at length, and
can assist in measuring well-being. Please see our medical disclaimer

Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical
fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for various reasons,
to aid growth and improve strength, prevent aging, develop muscles and
the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance,
improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise
outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve
well-being as well as mental health. In terms of health benefits, the amount of
recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of
the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.
С новым годом! 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady
running, tend to produce a lowering of the diastolic blood pressure during exercise,
due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the systolic
pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.
Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can contribute to
maintaining a healthy weight, regulating the digestive system, building and
maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and joint mobility, promoting
physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune system.
Some studies indicate that exercise may increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life.
